- 4 pieces of every react component
    1. Import libraries we need to create a component
    2. Create a component - A function that returns some 'JSX'
    3. Create a stylesheet to style our component
    4. Export the component so we can use it elsewhere in our project

- React library is how different components work together 
- React native knows how to take information from components and show it on a mobile device
- Adding curly braces in an import means your import a specific section of a library
