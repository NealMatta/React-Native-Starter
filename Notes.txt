- 4 pieces of every react component
    1. Import libraries we need to create a component
    2. Create a component - A function that returns some 'JSX'
    3. Create a stylesheet to style our component
    4. Export the component so we can use it elsewhere in our project

- React library is how different components work together 
- React native knows how to take information from components and show it on a mobile device
- Adding curly braces in an import means your import a specific section of a library

Primitive Elements
- View == Div basically 

- the HTML looking stuff is called JSX. JSX is converted to javascript code using Babel 

Rules of JSX
- Semicolons are not needed when wrapped within a view element
- Why use JSX at all? 
    - It basically simplifies the process of writing javascript 
- [1 - ComponentsScreen.js] We can refer to JS Variables inside of a JSX block by using curly braces 
    - You cannot however show a JS Object inside of a text element
    - Have the ability to assign a JSX thing to a JS variable and then call the JS variable. Why?
        - May want to create JSX conditionally ahead of time so we may want to put an image or text value instead
            - This is like v-if kinda 
- Frequent Errors:


- What's App Navigator? 
    - It's from a tool called React Navigation
    - Basically showing different content to a user 
- How does Styles really work?
    - The reason you use stylesheet.create is because it automatically validates different stylign rules to stlyes we create

- Two different ways of showing a button to a user
    - primitive element --> button
        - Can't customize it too much though 
    - ToucableOpacity
        - More like an A tag so that you can have more complex interactions

- State
    - tracking a piece of data that will change over time
    - Any time it changes, the app should 'rerender'
- Props
    - Communicating data from a parent to a child 
- Generally, we create state variables in the most parent component that needs to read or change a state value
- If a child neads to READ a state value, the parent component can pass the value down as a prop
- If a child needs to CHANGE a state value, the parent can pass down a callback function to change the state value as a prop
- Reducer
    - Function that manages changes to some kind of Object
    - Function that always gets called with two objects
